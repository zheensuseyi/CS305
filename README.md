# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
1. Artemis Financial is a consulting company that is in charge of a variety of different accounts which include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The issue they wanted me to address in Project 1 was focusing on important areas of security and doing a manual review of their code including a maven dependency check.
# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
2. What I did very well was find the vulnerabilites in the code and some others unsecure things that would not have been picked up by the dependency check. For example, there was a random comment in the code that had a username and password would if fallen into the wrong hands, could have been a disaster. Software security is critical to a company because if it isn't secure, cyberattacks can potentially be successful which can be a complete disaster for the company.
# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
3. Finding the hidden errors outside of the maven dependency check was the toughest part for me.
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
4. The best way to increase layers of security is to code with secure coding in mind in the first place. Another thing that can be done is keeping all libaries and dependencys up to date and conducting regular checks on them.
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
5. By conducting a dependency check and refactoring obvious errors in the code, I was able to determine the flaws in the code and make imporvements to them. I re-ran my dependency check to see if there were any new vulnerabilities when my code was refactored.
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
6. Reading the rubric carefully and the resources in the module really help out when it comes to doing assignments at SNHU
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
7. I would show them that I understand how important secure coding is and how refactoring code is an important skill to learn.
